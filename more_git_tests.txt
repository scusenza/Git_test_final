This is a final test for git. I may do a few more after this, however...
Anyway, I've learned that git is quite a powerful tool in web development,
especially when it comes to collaboration. Will I be working in this field
in the future? Maybe not. Will I learn some new skills? absolutely!

Just wanted to delete the last two lines to see what happens...
But I think I am understading more of the Git workflow!
